Mission
            <hr size="5" noshade="noshade" color="#336633" noshadow="noshadow" />
            <p>TAGAMA is an art and technology collaborative based in Stockholm, established in the Fall of 2002.  The primary members are <a href="who/peter.html">Peter Norrman</a>, <a href="who/marco.html">Marco ter Haar Romeny</a> and <a href="who/alisa.html">Alisa Grifo</a>.</p>
            <p>TAGAMA was formed to fight against the boredom of industry.  We transform everyday consumer electronics into creative tools for the people.  Our goal is to generate collaborative, often cross-cultural material in an automated manner and present our findings via installations at popular gathering points: a downtown city street corner, the center of a village, the major crossroads in a desert, etc.  We rely upon open source technology to make creative, engaging and entertaining solutions which inspire people to create collaboratively and / or show hidden aspects of technology in a creative manner.   We use technology as our tool but only to reachout to people. We always work to produce solutions which are entertaining, visually driven and inspiring.</p>

			Goals and considerations
			
			<hr size="5" noshade="noshade" color="#336633" noshadow="noshadow" />
            <p>1.To create solutions which encourage community collaboration and cooperative creativity.</p>
            <p>2.Automation, meaning automated output, is a key element in all software solutions.</p>
            <p>3.Re-use of computer equipment and use of open source software is a goal so that we are not limited by budgetary and licensing issues and other such problems regarding closed applications. We create systems using 'outdated' equipment that allow us to achieve our goals whenever possible.</p>
            <p>4.We give back to the open source community all software that is created or modified during our projects.</p>
            <p>5.All of our projects function on a global basis and their final outcome is site specific.  Once the project template is created, the final presentation is dictated by the technical means available in each location. Therefore the project adapts to its location and in doing so it becomes more location specific in itself.</p>
            <p>6.Solutions are created so that they can be used today, tomorrow and yesterday, in varying forms.</p>
            <p>7.Projects are installed in benign community meeting points; direct access to the people is a requirement.</p>
            <p>8.Nothing is theoretical, nothing is academic.</p>
            <p>9.The goal is to create solutions that will touch everyone regardless of economic, political or social position.</p></td>
